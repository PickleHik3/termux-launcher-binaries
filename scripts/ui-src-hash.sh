# A stable hash of the ui/ crate sources (src/**, Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock).
#
#   scripts/ui-src-hash.sh
#
# Two callers must ever run this and must always agree:
#   - ui/build.rs, at compile time, bakes the result into the binary
#     (TLSTORE_UI_SRC_HASH, printed by `tlstore-ui --version`).
#   - scripts/check-dist.sh (the launcher's own app/build.gradle checkTlstoreUiFresh task
#     did this before the store moved here), which recomputes it from the working tree
#     and compares it against what the built dist/tlstore-ui-<abi> binaries have baked in, so a
#     source change that never made it through `build-ui.sh --install` is caught instead of
#     shipping a stale tlstore-ui.
#
# Paths are hashed relative to the crate root so the result does not depend on which worktree
# or absolute path it is run from.
